## 1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal
### You are given two strings s1 and s2 of equal length. A string swap is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.

### Return true if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing at most one string swap on exactly one of the strings. Otherwise, return false.

 

### Example 1:
* Input: s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"
* Output: true
* Explanation: For example, swap the first character with the last character of s2 to make "bank".
### Example 2:
* Input: s1 = "attack", s2 = "defend"
* Output: false
* Explanation: It is impossible to make them equal with one string swap.
### Example 3:
* Input: s1 = "kelb", s2 = "kelb"
* Output: true
* Explanation: The two strings are already equal, so no string swap operation is required.
 

## Constraints:
* 1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100
* s1.length == s2.length
* s1 and s2 consist of only lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
  def areAlmostEqual(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
      diffIndices = [i for i, (a, b) in enumerate(zip(s1, s2)) if a != b]
      return not diffIndices or (len(diffIndices) == 2 and
                                 s1[diffIndices[0]] == s2[diffIndices[1]] and
                                 s1[diffIndices[1]] == s2[diffIndices[0]])
```

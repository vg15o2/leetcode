## 1980. Find Unique Binary String

### Problem Statement
Given an array of strings `nums` containing `n` unique binary strings, each of length `n`, return a binary string of length `n` that does not appear in `nums`. If there are multiple answers, you may return any of them.

### Examples
#### Example 1:
**Input:**
```plaintext
nums = ["01","10"]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
"11"
```
**Explanation:**
`"11"` does not appear in `nums`. `"00"` would also be correct.

#### Example 2:
**Input:**
```plaintext
nums = ["00","01"]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
"11"
```
**Explanation:**
`"11"` does not appear in `nums`. `"10"` would also be correct.

#### Example 3:
**Input:**
```plaintext
nums = ["111","011","001"]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
"101"
```
**Explanation:**
`"101"` does not appear in `nums`. Other valid answers include `"000"`, `"010"`, `"100"`, and `"110"`.

### Constraints:
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 16`
- `nums[i].length == n`
- `nums[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
- All the strings in `nums` are unique.

Solution Py 3
```Python3 []
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findDifferentBinaryString(self, nums: List[str]) -> str:
        n = len(nums)
        result = []
        for i in range(n):
            # Choose the i-th character to be different from the i-th character of the i-th string
            result.append('1' if nums[i][i] == '0' else '0')
        return ''.join(result)

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
nums = ["01", "10"]
print(solution.findDifferentBinaryString(nums))  # Output: "11"
```

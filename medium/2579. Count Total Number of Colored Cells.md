## 2579. Count Total Number of Colored Cells

There exists an infinitely large two-dimensional grid of uncolored unit cells. You are given a positive integer `n`, indicating that you must do the following routine for `n` minutes:

- At the first minute, color any arbitrary unit cell blue.
- Every minute thereafter, color blue every uncolored cell that touches a blue cell.

Below is a pictorial representation of the state of the grid after minutes 1, 2, and 3.

## Example 1:

**Input:**
```plaintext
n = 1
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
1
```

**Explanation:**
After 1 minute, there is only 1 blue cell, so we return `1`.

## Example 2:

**Input:**
```plaintext
n = 2
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
5
```

**Explanation:**
After 2 minutes, there are 4 colored cells on the boundary and 1 in the center, so we return `5`.

## Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`

CPP solution
```cpp []
class Solution {
 public:
  long long coloredCells(int n) {
    return static_cast<long>(n) * n + static_cast<long>(n - 1) * (n - 1);
  }
};
```

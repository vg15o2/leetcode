## 1718. Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence
Given an integer n, find a sequence that satisfies all of the following:

- The integer 1 occurs once in the sequence.
- Each integer between 2 and n occurs twice in the sequence.
- For every integer i between 2 and n, the distance between the two occurrences of i is exactly i.
- The distance between two numbers on the sequence, a[i] and a[j], is the absolute difference of their indices, |j - i|.

Return the lexicographically largest sequence. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is always a solution.

A sequence a is lexicographically larger than a sequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, sequence a has a number greater than the corresponding number in b. For example, [0,1,9,0] is lexicographically larger than [0,1,5,6] because the first position they differ is at the third number, and 9 is greater than 5.

### Example 1:
**Input:** n = 3  
**Output:** [3,1,2,3,2]  
**Explanation:** [2,3,2,1,3] is also a valid sequence, but [3,1,2,3,2] is the lexicographically largest valid sequence.

### Example 2:
**Input:** n = 5  
**Output:** [5,3,1,4,3,5,2,4,2]

### Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 20

    def constructDistancedSequence(self, n: int) -> List[int]:

        seq, used, result = [0] * size, [0] * (n + 1), None
        
        def backtrack(pos):
            nonlocal result
            if result is not None: return True
            while pos < size and seq[pos] != 0: pos += 1
            if pos >= size: result = seq.copy(); return True
            for i in range(n, 0, -1):
                if i == 1 and not used[i]:
                    seq[pos], used[i] = i, 1
                    if backtrack(pos + 1): return True
                    seq[pos], used[i] = 0, 0
                elif i != 1 and not used[i] and pos + i < size and seq[pos + i] == 0:
                    seq[pos], seq[pos + i], used[i] = i, i, 2
                    if backtrack(pos + 1): return True
                    seq[pos], seq[pos + i], used[i] = 0, 0, 0
            return False
        
        backtrack(0)
        return result

## 72.Edit Distance

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

- **Insert** a character  
- **Delete** a character  
- **Replace** a character  

### Example 1:
```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

## Constraints:
- `0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

    def __init__(self):
        self.memo = None

    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        l1 = len(word1)
        l2 = len(word2)

        # [i][j] = min distance at word1[0~i] and word2[0~j]
        # init as -1 : not cacluated yet
        self.memo = [[-1] * l2 for _ in range(l1)]

        # search from the last index
        return self.dp(word1, l1 - 1, word2, l2 - 1)

    def dp(self, word1: str, i: int, word2: str, j: int) -> int:
        # run out of word1 then return the length of word2; and vise versa
        if i == -1:
            return j + 1
        if j == -1:
            return i + 1

        # using memo for quick return
        if self.memo[i][j] != -1:
            return self.memo[i][j]

        # there are 4 cases to try

        # 1st case: char are equal, then move leftward together
        if word1[i] == word2[j]:
            self.memo[i][j] = self.dp(word1, i - 1, word2, j - 1)

        # char are not equal, then try to insert, delete or replace a char in word1
        else:
            # insert: i holds its position and j move leftward
            num_insert = self.dp(word1, i - 1, word2, j) + 1  # 1 operatoin

            # delete: i move leftward and j holds its position
            num_delete = self.dp(word1, i, word2, j - 1) + 1  # 1 operatoin

            # replace: both i and j move leftward
            num_replace = self.dp(word1, i - 1, word2, j - 1) + 1  # 1 operation

            # take the min one
            self.memo[i][j] = min(num_insert, num_delete, num_replace)

        return self.memo[i][j]
```

### Punishment Number Problem

**Given a positive integer n, return the punishment number of n.**

The punishment number of n is defined as the sum of the squares of all integers i such that:

- 1 <= i <= n
- The decimal representation of i * i can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals i.

---

**Example 1:**

Input: n = 10  
Output: 182  
Explanation:  
There are exactly 3 integers i in the range [1, 10] that satisfy the conditions in the statement:
- 1 since 1 * 1 = 1
- 9 since 9 * 9 = 81 and 81 can be partitioned into 8 and 1 with a sum equal to 8 + 1 == 9.
- 10 since 10 * 10 = 100 and 100 can be partitioned into 10 and 0 with a sum equal to 10 + 0 == 10.

Hence, the punishment number of 10 is 1 + 81 + 100 = 182

---

**Example 2:**

Input: n = 37  
Output: 1478  
Explanation:  
There are exactly 4 integers i in the range [1, 37] that satisfy the conditions in the statement:
- 1 since 1 * 1 = 1. 
- 9 since 9 * 9 = 81 and 81 can be partitioned into 8 + 1. 
- 10 since 10 * 10 = 100 and 100 can be partitioned into 10 + 0. 
- 36 since 36 * 36 = 1296 and 1296 can be partitioned into 1 + 29 + 6.

Hence, the punishment number of 37 is 1 + 81 + 100 + 1296 = 1478

---

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= n <= 1000

### Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def punishmentNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        def can_partition(s: str, target: int, curr: int = 0, start: int = 0) -> bool:
            if start == len(s): return curr == target
            for i in range(start, len(s)):
                if s[start] == '0' and i > start: break
                num = int(s[start:i + 1])
                if curr + num > target: break
                if can_partition(s, target, curr + num, i + 1): return True
            return False
        
        return sum(i * i for i in range(1, n + 1) if can_partition(str(i * i), i))
```

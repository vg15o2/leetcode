## 3066. Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value II
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, and an integer `k`.

In one operation, you will:
- Take the two smallest integers `x` and `y` in `nums`.
- Remove `x` and `y` from `nums`.
- Add `min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y)` anywhere in the array.

**Note:** You can only apply the described operation if `nums` contains at least two elements.

Return the **minimum number of operations** needed so that **all elements of the array are greater than or equal to** `k`.

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
nums = [2,11,10,1,3]
k = 10
```
**Output:**
```
2
```
**Explanation:**  
- In the first operation, we remove elements `1` and `2`, then add `1 * 2 + 2 = 4` to `nums`. 
  `nums` becomes `[4, 11, 10, 3]`.
- In the second operation, we remove elements `3` and `4`, then add `3 * 2 + 4 = 10` to `nums`. 
  `nums` becomes `[10, 11, 10]`.

At this stage, all elements are `>= 10`, so we stop.
The minimum number of operations is **2**.

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```
nums = [1,1,2,4,9]
k = 20
```
**Output:**
```
4
```
**Explanation:**  
- After **one operation**, `nums` becomes `[2, 4, 9, 3]`.
- After **two operations**, `nums` becomes `[7, 4, 9]`.
- After **three operations**, `nums` becomes `[15, 9]`.
- After **four operations**, `nums` becomes `[33]`.

All elements are now `>= 20`, so we stop.
The minimum number of operations is **4**.

---

### Constraints:
- `2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`
- The input is generated such that an answer always exists.

```python []
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Convert array to min heap
        import heapq
        heap = nums.copy()
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        operations = 0
        
        # Continue until all numbers are >= k
        while len(heap) >= 2 and heap[0] < k:
            # Get two smallest elements
            x = heapq.heappop(heap)
            y = heapq.heappop(heap)
            
            # Calculate new value and push back to heap
            new_val = min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y)
            heapq.heappush(heap, new_val)
            operations += 1
            
        return operations
```

## 336. Palindrome Pairs
### You are given a 0-indexed array of unique strings words.
### A palindrome pair is a pair of integers (i, j) such that:
* 0 <= i, j < words.length,
* i != j, and
* words[i] + words[j] (the concatenation of the two strings) is a palindrome.
### Return an array of all the palindrome pairs of words.
### You must write an algorithm with O(sum of words[i].length) runtime complexity.


### Example 1:
* Input: words = ["abcd","dcba","lls","s","sssll"]
* Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,2],[2,4]]
* Explanation: The palindromes are ["abcddcba","dcbaabcd","slls","llssssll"]
### Example 2:
* Input: words = ["bat","tab","cat"]
* Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
* Explanation: The palindromes are ["battab","tabbat"]
### Example 3:
* Input: words = ["a",""]
* Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
* Explanation: The palindromes are ["a","a"]

### Constraints:
* 1 <= words.length <= 5000
* 0 <= words[i].length <= 300
* words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

```Python []
class Solution:
  def palindromePairs(self, words: list[str]) -> list[list[int]]:
    ans = []
    dict = {word[::-1]: i for i, word in enumerate(words)}

    for i, word in enumerate(words):
      if "" in dict and dict[""] != i and word == word[::-1]:
        ans.append([i, dict[""]])

      for j in range(1, len(word) + 1):
        l = word[:j]
        r = word[j:]
        if l in dict and dict[l] != i and r == r[::-1]:
          ans.append([i, dict[l]])
        if r in dict and dict[r] != i and l == l[::-1]:
          ans.append([dict[r], i])

    return ans
```
